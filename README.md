# GaiaVisionMVP
MVP (Minimum Viable Project) for the OurWaveHub co-op of the summer of 2022!  
Over the course of 5 weeks, we had to learn Xcode/Swift in order to create an application!
This is my first (and probably last) app that I created in Swift/Xcode and I think it's quite decent given the time frame.  

I chose the issue of informing people about climate change through an app which gives statistics and tips on how to reduce climate change
